			<p class="info">What makes their model successful, is the constant interaction and communication between their 
			online and ground marketing team members. The online marketing team members are considered the ones 
			that open the door, while the event planners are the closers. Getting someone to commit to attending 
			an event is hard, but getting them to sign a contract is a little more complicated. That's why at Unique  
			Visions their strongest tool is communication. No job is too small or too hard, the client’s success is 
			the company’s success.</p>
			
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>The mission, is to successfully get musicians to their next of their journey, by introducing them to people with the power to help them succeed in their future endeavors.</p>
